# Before you play: 

The game is created by regeditexe. It's open source this time.  

1. open the **game** folder
2. click RMB on the empty space in the window
3. click more options and “Open in terminal” 
4. type “python main.py”. Make sure you have Python and pygame installed on your computer. 
5. play!

You can also run the script start_game.bat and don't fiddle with cmd, the script does everything for you!

### This is a fork of kebab clicker, a game also by me. 

Press "M" to mute. It's fiddly, so press it twice for the first time.
